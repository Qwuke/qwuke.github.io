    <h2>Hi, I'm Tristan Mortimer</h2>
    <p>I'm a software engineer who loves <span title="Really, post-punk, but who cares">punk rock</span>, high energy physics, and backpacking to the middle of nowhere.</p>
    <p>I nerd out about modern languages, supply-chain security, low-level programming, and high availability systems.</p>
    <p>In the past, I was the organizer of the Detroit Rust lang meetup, and scaled privacy-aware analytics platforms at Amazon.</p>
