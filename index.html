	<!-- The Distance of the Moon –Italo Calvino

	At one time, according to Sir George H. Darwin, the Moon was very close to the Earth.
	Then the tides gradually pushed her far away: the tides that the Moon herself causes in the Earth’s waters, where the Earth slowly loses energy.

	How well I know! –old Qfwfq cried– the rest of you can’t remember, but I can.
	We had her on top of us  all  the  time,  that  enormous  Moon:  when  she  was  full –nights  as  bright  as  day,  but  with  the butter-coloured  light –it  looked  as  if she  were  going  to  crush  us;
	when  she  was  new,  she  rolled around  the  sky  like  a  black  umbrella  blown  by  the  wind;
	and  when  she  was  waxing,  she  came forward  with  her  horns  so  low  she  seemed  about  to  stick  into  the  peak  of  a  promontory  and  get caught there.
	But the whole business of the Moon’s phases worked in a different way then: because the  distances  from  the  Sun  were  different,  and  the  orbits,  and  the  angle  of  something  or  other,  I forget  what;
	as  for  eclipses,  with Earth  and Moon  stuck  together  the  way  they  were, why,  we  had eclipses  every  minute:
	naturally,  those  two  big  monsters  managed  to  put  each  other  in  the  shade constantly, first one, then the other.
	Orbit? Oh, elliptical, of course: for a while it would huddle against us and then it would take flight for a while.
	The tides, when the Moon swung closer, rose so high nobody could hold them back.
	There were  nights  when  the  Moon  was  full  and  very,  very  low,  and  the  tide  was  so  high  that  the  Moon missed a ducking in the sea by a hair’s-breadth; well, let’s say a few yards anyway.
	Climb up on the Moon?  Of  course  we  did.  All  you  had  to  do  was  row  out  to  it  in  a  boat  and,  when  you  were underneath it, prop a ladder against her and scramble up.
	The spot where the Moon was the lowers, as she went by, was off the Zinc Cliffs. We used to go out with those little rowing boats they had in those days, round and flat, made of cork.
	They held quite a few  of  us:  me,  Captain  Vhd  Vhd,  his  wife,  my  deaf  cousin,  and  sometimes  little  Xlthlx –she  was twelve or so at the time.
	On those nights the water was very calm, so silvery it looked like mercury, and the fish in it, violet-coloured, unable to resist the Moon’s attraction, rose to the surface, all of them, and so did the octopuses and the saffron medusas.
	There was alwaysa flight of tiny creatures –little crabs, squid, and even some weeds, light and filmy, and coral plants –that broke from the sea and  ended  up  on  the  Moon,  hanging  down  from  that  lime-white  ceiling,  or  else  they  stayed  in midair, a phosphorescent swarm we had to drive off, waving banana leaves at them.
	This is how we did the job: in the boat we had a ladder: one of us held it, another climbed to the top, and a third, at the oars, rowed until we were right under the Moon;
	that’s why there had to be so many of us  (I  only  mentioned  the  main  ones).
	The  man  at  the  top  of  the  ladder,  as  the  boat approached the Moon, would become scared and start shouting: ‘Stop! Stop! I’m going to bang my head!’
	That was the impression you had, seeing her on top of you, immense,and  all  rough  with sharp spikes and jagged, saw-tooth edges.
	It may be different now, but then the Moon, or rather the bottom, the underbelly of the Moon, the part that passed closest to the Earth and almost scraped it, was covered with a crust of sharp scales.
	It had come to resemble the belly of a fish, and the smell too, as I recall, if not downright fishy, was faintly similar, like smoked salmon.
	In reality, from the top of the ladder, standing erect on the last rung, you could just touch the Moon if you held your arms up.
	We had taken the measurements carefully (we didn’t yet suspect that she was moving away from us); the only thing you had to be very careful about was where you put your hands.
	I always chose a scale that seemed fast (we climbed up ingroups of five or six at a time), then I  would  cling  first  with  one  hand,  then  with  both,  and  immediately  I  would  feel  ladder  and  boat drifting away from below me, and the motion of the Moon would tear me from the Earth’s attraction.
	Yes, the Moon was so strong that she pulled you up; you realized this the moment you passed from oneto the other: you had to swing up abruptly, with a kind of somersault, grabbing the scales, throwing your legs over your head, until your feet were on the Moon’s surface.
	Seen from the Earth, you looked as if you were handing there with your head down, but for you, it was the normal position,  and  the  only  odd  thing  was  that  when  you  raised  your  eyes  you  saw  the  sea  above  you, glistening, with the boat and the others upside down, handing like a bunch of grapes from a vine.
	My cousin, the Deaf One, showed a special talent for making those leaps. His clumsy hands, as soon as  they  touched  the  lunar  surface  (he  was  always  the  first  to jumpup  from  the  ladder),  suddenly became deft andsensitive.
	They found immediately the spot where he could hoist himself up; in fact just the pressure of his palms seemed enough to make him stick to the satellite’s crust.
	Once I even thought I saw the Moon come towards him, as he held out his hands. He was  just  as  dextrous  in comingback  down  to  Earth,  an  operation  still  more  difficult.
	For  us,  it consisted in jumping, as high as we could, our arms upraised (seen from the Moon, that is, because seen from the Earth it looked more like a dive, or like swimming downwards, arms at our sides), like jumping up from the Earth in other words, only now we were without the ladder, because there was nothing  to  prop  it  against on  the  Moon.
	But  instead of jumping with  his  arms out, my  cousin  bent towards the Moon’s surface, his head down as if he were supporting the Moon’s enormous ball and were  tossing  it,  striking  it  with  his  palms;
	then,  when  his  legs  came  within  reach,  we  managed  to grab his ankles and pull him down on board. Now, you will ask me what in the world we went up on the Moon for; I’ll explain it to you.
	We went to  collect  the  milk,  with  a  big  spoon  and  a  bucket. Moon-milk  was  very  thick,  like  a  kind  of  cream cheese.
	It  formed  in  the  crevices  between  on  scale  and  the  next,  through  the  fermentation  of various bodies and substances of terrestrial origin which had flown up from the prairies and forests and  lakes,  as  the  Moon  sailed  over  them.
	It  was  composed  chiefly  of  vegetal  juices,  tadpoles, bitumen, lentils, honey, starch crystals, sturgeon, eggs, moulds, pollens, gelatinous matter, worms, resins,  pepper,  mineral  salts,  combustion  residue.  You  had  only  to  dip  the  spoon  under  the  scales that covered the Moon’s scabby terrain, and you broughtit out filled with that precious muck. Not in the  pure  state,  obviously;  there  was  a  lot  of  refuse.  In  the  fermentation  (which  took  place  as  the Moon  passed  over  the  expanses  of  hot  air  above  the  deserts)  not  all  the  bodies  melted;  some remained  stuck  in  it:  fingernails  and  cartilage,  bolts,  sea  horses,  nuts  and  peduncles,  shards  of crockery, fish-hooks, at times  even a comb. So this paste, after it was collected, had to be refined, filtered. But that wasn’t the difficulty: the hard part was transporting it down to the Earth. This is how we did it: we hurled each spoonful into the air with both hands, using the spoon as a catapult. The cheese flew, and if we had thrown it hard enough, it stuck to the ceiling, I mean the surface of the sea. Once there, it floated, and itwas easy enough to pull it into the boat. In this operation, too, my deaf cousin displayed a special gift; he had strength and a good aim; with a single, sharp throw, he  could  send  the  cheese  straight  into  a  bucket  we  held  up  to  him  from  the  boat.  As  for  me,  I occasionally misfired; the contents of the spoon would fail to overcome the Moon’s attraction and they would fall back into my eyes. 
	I still haven’t told you everything about the things my cousin was good at. That job of extracting lunar milk from the Moon’s scales was child’s play to him: instead of the spoon, at times he had only to thrust his bare hand under the scales, or even one finger.
	He didn’t proceed in any orderly way, but went to isolated places, jumping from one to the other, as if he were playing tricks on the Moon, surprising her, or perhaps tickling her.
	And wherever he put his hand, the milk spurted out as if from a nanny goat’s teats.
	So the rest of us had only to follow him and collect with our spoons the substance that he was pressing out, first here, then there, but always as if by chance, since the Deaf One’s movements seemed to have no clear, practical sense.
	There were places, for example, that he touched merely for the fun of touching them: gaps between two scales, naked and tender folds of lunar flesh.
	At times my cousin pressednot only his fingers but –in a carefully gauged leap –his big toe (he climbed on to the Moon barefoot) and this seemed to be the height of amusement for him, if we could judge by the chirping sounds that came from his throat as he went on leaping.
	The soil of the Moon was not uniformly scaly, but revealed irregular bare patched of pale, slippery clay.
	These soft areas inspired the Deaf One to turn somersaults or to fly almost like a bird, as if he wanted to impress his whole body into the Moon’s pulp.
	As he ventured further in this way, we lost sight  of  him  at  one  point.
	On  the  Moon  there  were  vast  areas  we  had  never  had  any  reason  or curiosity  to  explore,  and  that  was  where  my  cousin  vanished;
	I  had  suspected  that  all  those somersaults  and  nudges  he  indulged  in  before  your  eyes  were  only  a  preparation,  a  prelude  to something secret meant to take place in the hidden zones.
	We fell into a special mood on those nights off the Zinc Cliffs: gay, but with a touch of suspense, as if inside  our  skills,  inside  ofthe  brain,  we  felt  a  fish,  floating,  attracted  by  the  Moon.
	And  so  we navigated, playing and singing. The Captain’s wife played the harp; she had very long arms, silvery as eels on those nights, and armpits as dark and mysterious as sea urchins;
	and the sound of the harp was sweet and piercing, so sweet and piercing it was almost unbearable, and we were forced to let out long cries, not so much to accompany the music as to protect our hearing from it.
	Transparent medusas rose to the sea’s surface, throbbedthere  a  moment,  then  flew  off,  swaying towards the Moon. Little Xlthlx amused herself by catching them in midair, though it wasn’t easy.
	Once, as she stretched her little arms out to catch one, she jumped up slightly and was also set free.
	Thin  as  she  was, she was an ounce or two short of the weight necessary for the Earth’s gravity to overcome the Moon’s attraction and bring her back: so she flew up among the medusas, suspended over the sea.
	She took fright, cried, then laughed and started playing, catching shellfish and minnows as they flew, sticking some into her mouth and chewing them. We rowed hard, to keep up with the child:
	the Moon ran off in her ellipse, dragging that swarm of marine fauna through the sky, and a train  of  long,  entwined  seaweeds,  and  Xlthlx  hanging  there  in  the  midst.
	Her  two  wispy  braids seemed  to  be  flying  on  their  own,  outstretched  towards  the  Moon;
	but  all  the  while  she  le[t wriggling and kicking at the air, as if she wanted to fight that influence, and her socks –she had lost her  shoes  in  the  fight –slipped off her feet and swayed, attracted by the Earth’s force.
	On the ladder, we tried to grab them. The idea of eating the little animals in the air had been a good one; the more weight Xlthlx gained, the  more  she  sank  towards  the  Earth;
	in  fact,  since  among  those  hovering  bodies  her  was  the largest,  molluscs  and  seaweeds  and  plankton  began  to  gravitate  about  her,  and  soon  the  child  was covered with siliceous little shells, chitinous carapaces and fibres of sea plants.
	And the further she vanished into that tangle, the more she was freed of the Moon’s influence, until she grazed the surface of the water and sank into the sea.
	We rowed quickly, to pull her out and save her: her body had remained magnetized, and we had to work hard to scrape of all the things encrusted on her.
	Tender corals were wound about her head, and every time we ran the comb through her hair there was a shower of crayfish and sardines; her eyes were sealed shut by limpets clinging to the lids with their suckers;
	squids’ tentacles were coiled around her arms and her neck; and her little dress now seemed woven only of weeds and sponges.
	We got the worst of it off her, but for weeks afterwards she went on pulling outfins and shells, and her  skin,  dotted  with  little  diatoms,  remained  affected  forever, looking –to someone who didn’t observe her carefully –as if it were faintly dusted with freckles.
	This should give you an idea of how the influences of Earth and Moon, practically equal, fought over the space between them.
	I’ll tell you something else: a body that descended to the Earth from the satellite was still charged for a while with lunar force and rejected the attraction of our world.
	Even I, big and heavy as I was: every time I had been up there, I took a while toget used to the Earth’s up and its down, and the others would have to grab my arms and hold me, clinging in a bunch  in the swaying boat whilst I still had my head hanging and my legs stretching upwards to the sky.
	‘Hold on! Hold on to us!’ they shouted at me, and in all that groping, sometimes I ended up seizing one of Mrs Vhd Vhd’s breasts, which were round and firm and the contact was good and secure and had an attraction as strong as the Moon’s or even stronger, especially if I managed, as I plunged down, to put my other arm around her hips, and with this I passed back into our world and fell with a thud into the bottom of the boat, where Captain Vhd Vhd brought me around, throwing a bucket of water in my face.
	This is how the story of my love for the Captain’s wife began, and my suffering. Because it didn’t take me long to realize whom the lady kept looking at insistently:
	when my cousin’s hands clasped the satellite,  I  watched  Mrs  Vhd  Vhd,  and  in  her  eyes  I  could  read  the  thoughts  that  the  deaf man’s familiarity  with  the  Moon  were  arousing  in  her;
	and  when  he  disappeared  in  his  mysterious  lunar explorations,  I  saw  her  become  restless,  as  if  on  pins  and  needles,  and  then  it  was  all clear to  me, how Mrs Vhd Vhd was becoming jealous of the Moon and I was jealous of my cousin.
	Her eyes were made of diamonds, Mrs Vhd Vhd’s; they flared when she looked at the Moon, almost challengingly, as if she were saying: ‘You shan’t have him!’ And I felt like an outsider.
	The  one  who  least  understood  all  of  this  was  my deaf  cousin.
	When  we  helped  him  down,  pulling him –as I explained to you –by his legs, Mrs Vhd Vhd lost all her self-control, doing everything she could  to  take  this  weight  against  her  own  body,  folding  her  long  silvery  arms  around  him;
	I  felt  a pang in my heart (the times I clung to her, her body was soft and kind, but not thrust forward, the way it was with my cousin), while he was indifferent, still lost in his lunar bliss.
	I looked over at the Captain, wondering if he also noticed his wife’s behaviour; but there was never a trace  of  any  expression  on  that  face  of  his,  eaten  by  brine,  marked  with  tarry  wrinkles.
	Since  the Deaf One was always the last to break away from the Moon, his return was the signal for the boats to move off.
	Then, with an unusually polite gesture, Vhd Vhd picked up the harp from the bottom of the boat and handed it to his wife. She was obliged to take it and play a few  notes.
	Nothing could separate her more  from  the  Deaf One  than  the  sound  of  the  harp.  I  took  to  singing  in  a  low  voice that sad song that goes:
	‘Every shiny fish is floating, floating; and every dark fish is at the bottom, at the bottom of the sea...’ and all the others, except my cousin, echoed my words.
	Every  month,  once  the  satellite  had  moved  on,  the  Deaf  One  returned  to  his  solitary  detachment from  things  of  the  world;  only  the  approach  of  the  full  moon  aroused  him  again.
	That  time  I  had arranged things so it wasn’t my turn to go up, I could stay in the boat with the Captain’s wife.
	But then,  as  soon  as  my  cousin had climbed the ladder, Mrs Vhd Vhd said: ‘This time I want to go up there, too!’ This had never happened before; the Captain’s wife had never gone upon the Moon.
	But Vhd Vhd made no objection, in fact he almost pushed her up the ladder bodily, exclaiming: ‘Go ahead then!’
	and we all started helping her, and I held her from behind, felt her round and soft on my arms, and to hold her up I began to press my face and the palms of my hands against her, and when I felt her rising into the Moon’s sphere I was heartsick at that lost contact, so I started to rush ager her, saying ‘I’m going to go up for a while, too, to help out!’
	I was held back as if in a vice. ‘You stay here; you have work to do later,’ the Captain commanded, without raising his voice. At that moment each one’s intentions were already clear.
	And yet I couldn’t figure things out; even now I’m not sure I’ve interpreted it all correctly.
	Certainly the Captain’s wife had for a long time been  cherishing  the  desire  to  go  off  privately  with  my  cousin  up  there  (or  at  least  to  prevent  him from  going  off  alone  with  the  Moon),  but  probably  she  has  a  still  more  ambitious  plan,  one  that would have to be carried out in agreement with the Deaf One:
	she wanted the two of them to hide up there together and stay on the Moon for a month.
	But perhaps my cousin, deaf as he was, hadn’t understood anything ofwhat she had tried to explain to him, or perhaps he hadn’t even realized that he was the object of the lady’s desires.
	And the Captain? He wanted nothing better than to be rid of his wife;
	in fact, as soon as she was confined up there, we saw him give free rein to his inclinations and  plunge  into  vice,  and  then  we  understood  why  he  done  nothing  to  hold  her  back.
	But  had  he known from the beginning that the Moon’s orbit was widening? None of us could have suspected it.
	The Deaf One perhaps, but only he: in the shadowy way he knew things,  he  may  have  had  a  presentiment  that  he  would  be  forced  to  bid  the  Moon  farewell  that night.
	This  is  why  he  hid  in  his  secret  places and  reappeared  only  when  it  was  time  to  come  back down on board.
	It was no use for the Captain’s wife to try to follow him:
	we saw her cross the scaly zone various times,  length and breadth, then suddenly she stopped, looking at us in the boat, as if about to ask us whether we had seen him.
	Surely there was something strange about that night.
	The sea’s surface, instead of being taught as it was during the full moon, or even arched a bit towards the sky, now seemed limp, sagging, as if the lunar magnet no longer exercised its full power.
	And the light, too, wasn’t the same as the light of other full moons; the night’s shadows seemed  somehow  to  have  thickened.
	Our  friends  up  there must have realized what was happening; in fact, they looked up at us with frightened eyes. And from their mouths andours, at the same moment, came a cry: ‘The Moon’s going away!’
	The cry hadn’t died out what my cousin appeared on the Moon, running. He didn’t seem frightened, or even  amazed:
	he  placed  his  hands on  the  terrain,  flinging  himself  into  his  usual  somersault, but this  time  after  he  had  hurled  himself  into  the  air  he  remained  suspended,  as  little  Xlthlx  has.
	He hovered a moment between Moon and Earth, upside down, then laboriously moving his arms, like someone swimming against a current, he headed with unusual slowness towards our planet.
	From the Moon the other sailors hastened to follow his example. Nobody gave a thought to getting the Moon-milk that had been collected into the boats, nor did the Captain scold them for this.
	They had already waited too long, the distance was difficult to cross by now; when they tried to imitate my cousin’s leap or his swimming, they remained there groping, suspended in midair.
	‘Cling together! Idiots! Cling together!’ the Captain yelled. At this command, the sailors tried to form  a group, a mass, to push all together until they reached the zone of the Earth’s attraction:
	all of a sudden a cascade of bodies plunged into the sea with a loud splash. The boats were now rowing to pick them up. ‘Wait! The Captain’s wife is missing!’ I  shouted.
	The Captain’s wife had also tried to jump, but she was still floating only a few yards from the Moon, slowly moving her long, silvery arms in the air.
	I climbed up the ladder, and in a vain attempt to give her something to grasp I held out the harp towards her. ‘I can’t reach her! We have to go after her!’ and I started to jump up, brandishing the harp.
	Above me the enormous lunar disc no longer seemed the  same  as  before:
	it  had  become  much  smaller,  it kept  contracting,  as  if my gaze  were  driving it away,  and  the  emptied  sky  gaped  like  an  abyss  where,  at  the  bottom,  the  stars  had  begun multiplying, and the night poured a river of emptiness over me, drowned me in dizziness and alarm.
	‘I’m afraid,’ I thought. ‘I’m too afraid to jump. I’m a coward!’and at that moment I jumped.
	I swam furiously through the sky, and held the harp out to her, and instead of coming towards me she rolled over and over, showing me first her impassive face and then her backside.
	‘Hold tight to me!’ I shouted, and I was already overtaking her, entwining my limbs with hers.
	‘If we cling together we can go down!’ and I was concentrating all my strength on uniting myself more closely with her, and I concentrated my sensations as I enjoyed the fullness of that embrace.
	I was so absorbed I didn’t realize at first that I was,  indeed,  tearing  her  from her  weightless  condition, but was making her fall back to the Moon. Didn’t I realize it?
	Or had that been my intention from the very beginning? Before I could think properly, a cry was already bursting from my throat. ‘I’ll be the one to stay with you for a month!’
	Or rather, ‘On you!’ I shouted, in my excitement: ‘On you for a month!’ and at that moment our embrace was broken by our fall to the Moon’s surface, where we rolled away fromeach other among those cold scales.
	I raised my eyes as I did every time I touched the Moon’s crust, sure that I would see above me the native sea like an endless ceiling, and I saw it, yes, I saw it this time, too, but much higher, and much more narrow, bound by its borders of coasts and cliffs and promontories, and how small the boats seemed, and how unfamiliar my friend’s faces and how weak their cries!
	A sound reached me from nearby: Mrs Vhd Vhd had discovered her harp and was caressing it, sketching out a chord as sad as weeping. A  long  month  began.  The  Moon  turned  slowly  around  the  Earth.
	On  the  suspended  globe  we  no longer saw our familiar shore, but the passage of oceans as deep as abysses and deserts of glowing lapilli,  and  continents  of  ice,  and forests  writhing  with  reptiles,  and  the  rocky  walls  of  mountain chains  gashed  by  swift  rivers,  and  swampy  cities,  and  stone  graveyards,  and  empires  of  clay  mud.
	The  distance  spread  a  uniform  colour  over  everything:  the  alien  perspectives  made  every  image alien;
	herds  of  elephant  and  swarms  of  locusts  ran  over  the  plains,  so  evenly  vast  and  dense  and thickly grown that there was no difference among them. I should have been happy:
	as I had dreamed, I was alone with her, that intimacy with the Moon I had so  often  envied  my  cousin  and  with  Mrs  Vhd  Vhd  was  now  my  exclusive  prerogative,  a  month  of days and lunar nights stretched uninterrupted before us, the crust of the satellite nourished us with its milk, whose tart flavour was familiar to us, we raised our eyes up, up to the world where we had been born, finally traversed in all its various expanse, explored landscapes no Earth-being had ever seen,  or  else  we contemplated the  stars  beyond  the  Moon,  big  as  pieces  of  fruit,  made  of  light, ripened on the curved branches of the sky, and everything exceeded my most luminous hopes, and yet, and yet, it was, instead, exile.
	I thought only of Earth. It was Earth that caused each of us to be that someone he was rather than someone else; up there, wrested from the Earth, it was as if I were no longer that I, nor she that She, for me.
	I was eager to return to the Earth, and I trembled at the fear of having lost it. The fulfilment of my dream of love had lasted only that instant when we had been united, spinning between Earth and Moon;
	torn from its earthly soil, my love now knew only this heart-rending nostalgia for what it lacked: a where, a surrounding, a before, an after. This  is  what  I  was  feeling.
	But  she?  As  I  asked  myself,  I  was  torn  by  my  fears.
	Because if  she  also thought only of the Earth, this could be a good sign, a sign that she had finally come to understand me,  but  it  could  also  mean  that everything had  been useless,  that  her  longings  were  directed  still and  only  towards  my  deaf  cousin.
	Instead,  she  felt  nothing.
	She  never  raised  her  eyes  to  the  old planet,  she  went  off,  pale,  among  those  wastelands,  mumbling  dirges  and  stroking  her  harp,  as  if completely  identified  with her  temporary  (as  I  thought)  lunar  state.
	Did  this  mean  I  had  won  out over my rival? No; I had lost: a hopeless defeat. Because she had finally realized that my cousin loved only the Moon, to be assimilated into the object of that extrahuman love.
	When the Moon had completed its circling of the planet, there we were again over the Zinc Cliffs.
	I recognized them with dismay: not even in my darkest previsions had I thought the distance  would have made them so tiny.
	In that mud puddle of the sea, my friends had set forth again, without the now  useless  ladders;  but  from  the  boats  rose  a  kind  of  forest  of  long  poles;
	everybody  was brandishing one, with a harpoon or grappling hook at the end, perhaps in the hope of scraping off a last bit of Moon-milk or of lending some kind of help to us wretches up there.
	But it was soon clear that  no  pole  was  long  enough  to  reach  the  Moon;  and  they  dropped  back,  ridiculously  short, humbled, floating on the sea;
	and in that confusion some of the boats were thrown off balance and overturned. But just then, from another vessel a longer pole, which till then they had dragged along on the water’s surface, began to rise:
	it must have been made of bamboo, of many, many bamboo poles stuck one into the other, and to raise it they had to go slowly because –thin as it was –if they let  it  sway  too  much  it  might  break.
	Therefore, they had  to  use  it  with  great  strength  and  skill, so that the wholly vertical weight wouldn’t rock the boat.
	Suddenly it was clear that the tip of that pole would touch the Moon, and we saw it graze, the press against the scaly terrain, rest there a moment, give a kind of little push, or rather a strong push that made it bounce off again, then come back and strike that same spot as if on the rebound, then move away once  more.
	And  I  recognized,  we  both –the Captain’s wife and I –recognized  my  cousin:
	it couldn’t have been anyone else, he was playing his last game with the Moon, one of his tricks, with the Moon on the tip of his pole as if he were juggling with her.
	And we realized that his virtuosity had no purpose, aimed at no practical result, indeed you would have said he was driving the Moon away,  that  he  was  helping  her  departure,  that  he  wanted  to  show  her  to  her  more  distance  orbit.
	And  this,  too,  was  just  like him:
	he was unable to conceive desires that went against the Moon’s nature, the Moon’s course and destiny and if the Moon now tended to go away from him, they he would take delight in this separation just as, till now, he had delighted in the Moon’s nearness.
	What  could  Mrs  Vhd  Vhd  do,  in  the  face  of  this? It  was  only  at  this  moment  that  she  proved  her passion  for  the  deaf  man hadn’t been a frivolous whim but an irrevocable vow.
	If what my cousin now  loved  was  the  distant  Moon,  then  she  too  would  remain distant,  on  the  Moon.
	I  sense  this, seeing that she didn’t take a step towards the bamboo pole, but simply turned her harp towards the Earth,  high  in  the  sky,  and  plucked  the  strings.
	I  say I  saw  her,  but  to  tell  the  truth  I  only  caught a glimpse  of  her  out  of  the  corner  of  my  eye,  because  the  minute  the  pole  had  touched  the  lunar crust,  I  had  sprung  and  grasped  it,  and  now,  fast  as a  snake,  I  was  climbing  up  the  bamboo  knots, pushing myself along with jerks of my arms and knees, light in the rarefied space, driven by a natural power that ordered me to return to the Earth, oblivious of the motive that had brought me here, or perhaps  more  aware  of  it than  ever  and  of  its  unfortunate  outcome;
	and  already  my  climb  up  the swaying pole had reached the point where I no longer had to make any afford but could just allow myself to slide, head first, attracted by the Earth, until in my haste the pole broke into a thousand pieces and I fell into the sea, among the boats.
	My return was sweet, my home refound, but my thoughts were filled only with grief at having lost her, and my eyes gazed at the Moon, for eve beyond my reach, as I sought her.
	And I saw her. She was there where I had left her, lying on a beach directly over our heads, and she said nothing.
	She was  the  colour  of  the  Moon; she  held  the  harp  at  her  side  and  moved  one  hand  now  and  then  in slow arpeggios.
	I could distinguish the shape of her bosom, her arms, her thighs, just as I remember them  now,  just  as  now,  when  the  Moon  has  become  that  flat,  remote  circle,  I  still  look  for  her  as soon as the first sliver appears in the sky, and the more it waxes, the more clearly I imagine I can see her, her or something of her, but only her, in a hundred, a thousand different vistas, she who makes the Moon the Moon and, whenever she is full, sets the dogs to howling all night long, and me with them.
